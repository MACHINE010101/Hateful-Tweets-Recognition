# Hatred on Twitter During MeToo Movement Dataset
### Author: Edaurd Pascale

In this report, I will provide an overview of data modeling, including its importance, process, and techniques used in developing a data model. I will then demonstrate the application of data modeling by using a dataset from kaggle.
This dataset belongs to the MeToo movement on Twitter. This movement was against the sexual harassment incidents and many people posted various hatred tweets. Using this dataset, we can build a model that can accurately classify hatred and non-hatred tweets to restrict its spread.

Problem definition

Research question: How do we build a model that is able to separate hateful vs. non-hateful tweets?

The main focus of this project is to build a model that is able to separate hateful vs. non-hateful tweets, this is done using a few feature columns related to tweets.

Other questions to answer:

What is the impact of the unbalanced data on your results? How can you mitigate it? What is the implication of using the random sampler, should we sample before diving the data into train and test, or after it? What happens if we apply the model trained on the sampled data on the entire dataset, does it work?
